  ## About
  This is a basic modal project, showcasing my first attempt at DOM manipulation. When the user clicks the "open" button, a modal window emerges, which can be dismissed by pressing the "esc" key, guiding the user back to the initial button view.
  
  Originally, the project's design was to simply exhibit a message instructing the user to click "esc". However, I opted to incorporate a personal touch. I've repurposed this into a whimsical digital "gift" for my boyfriend. That being said, its universal charm ensures that anyone can use it as a playful way to surprise someone special.

  On the main interface, there's a button that reads "Tem um presente pra você" (There's a gift for you). When activated, a heart shape reveals itself, along with the message "Meu coração" (My heart).
   
   ## Technologies Used
  * Tailwind CSS
  * JavaScript
   
   ## Potential Improvements
   The current version of the modal has a small limitation - the heart image isn't fully responsive. This is an aspect I plan to enhance in the upcoming versions.

   ## Conclusion
   This project was both an educational journey in DOM manipulation and a heartfelt endeavor. Feel free to clone, modify, and use it to bring a smile to someone's face!
